        <h1>Why is Git Useful?</h1>
        <p>
          If you were in a group of designers that’s goal was to create and demo a short-notice website redesign prototype, you’d most likely run into a lot of problems around version control. A group of designers working on a time budget means that they need all hands-on deck, which can get messy when multiple people are working on the same files. Git is the solution to this mess. Git lets the developers create branches where they can change, add, and remove features on the website and see how it looks without jeopardizing its functionality. Git is centralized which makes it very easy for all developers to find and access, this along with the branching system but makes committing changes and improvements super straightforward and painless regardless of how many people are working on the project. Because it is so easy for each designer to make changes, extremely rapid prototyping is possible which lets the development-feedback cycle work at high speed. When on a time-budget, rapid prototyping and quick feedback are essential for iterating a project in the right direction. Git is extremely helpful from the first stages where developers are spit balling ideas and seeing what sticks, to the late stages where they all have to put their work together and finalise the prototype.
